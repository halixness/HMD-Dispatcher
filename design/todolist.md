## Behaviors to handle

[ ] When the user asks its own questions in the middle of medical questions: for now, medical questions take any text as answer, which is wrong. If the user asks a question in the middle it doesn't work.
[ ] When the user answers medical questions and includes a question.
[ ] When the user opens the conversation with already info about the medical emergency: this requires recognizing the pathology as an entity and mapping the value to a slot that activates the right story. Or maybe recognizing the intent already and diverting the story.
